# Data-Structures
 A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently. It is a collection of data elements that are stored together and allows certain operations to be performed on them. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.
 
There are many different types of data structures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common data structures include:

* Arrays: An array is a linear data structure that stores data in a contiguous block of memory.
* Linked lists: A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes that are linked together.
* Stacks: A stack is a linear data structure that allows data to be inserted and deleted only at the top.
* Queues: A queue is a linear data structure that allows data to be inserted at the end and deleted at the beginning.
* Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that stores data in nodes that are connected to each other.
* Graphs: A graph is a non-linear data structure that stores data in nodes that are connected to each other by edges.
